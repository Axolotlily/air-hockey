## Teach your computer to play air hockey.

I started this project as an experiment to train a computer to play air hockey using samples from watching a human player.

Use your arrow keys to control the paddle on the left. After collecting some samples of your movement the computer will start training and will take control of the paddle on the right. From that point on it keeps learning from watching you. Press the SPACE key to randomize the setup (doing this gives better coverage for the training data to learn from).
